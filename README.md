## Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial Data Cleaning and Preparation Phase, i performed the following tasks:
- I imported the data which was in three different excel tab into Power query
- Due to different column names for different data table, I created a template for transformation 
- I created a parameters for filtering the source data
- I created a function from the template
- I invoked the function into all the different data tables.
- Expanded the data into one single table
